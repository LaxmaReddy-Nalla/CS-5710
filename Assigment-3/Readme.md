Question 1:

preprocess the Titanic Dataset and find the Columns 'sex' is useful or not using the pearson correlation.
Applied Gaussian Naive Bayes Algorithm to the Dataset.
Visualized the heatmap to get visual correlation matrix of dataset.

Question 2:

This is test weather the Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm or Lineat SVM is better performers on Glass Dataset
Applied both algorithms on glass dataset and evaluted which is better performer in scope of accuracy

The Linear SVM algorithm performs well on glass dataset because SVM is more powerful to handle classification task and it generalizes well in high dimensional data space. On the other hand Naïve Bayes works on the concept of conditional probability. 
The biggest difference between these two models is Gaussian Naïve bayes each feature as independent one while SVM tries to build a linear relationship between the features.
